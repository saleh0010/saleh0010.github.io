<p> A lot of people are finding out about uber and more and more people are using the app day by day. I used to live in Portland, therefore most of the riders that I got were people my age. Some were nice and very polite and always tipped me good. On the other hand I have had my fair share of rude customers that don't care about life. Old folks were always the ones the request then cancel, I still have no clue its always them who do that but that is how it's been. </p>

<p>Most people that I had were pleased and satisfied enough to have given me 149 five star trips. The more 5 star trips you get the better and the more money uber will give you. They also one time allowed a feature called "double tipping" which basically meant uber matching your tip with the same amount. For Example, If I had a $10 tip from a rider uber will throw me another $10 so I made twenty. They have definitely been the perfect second time job for me.

 <p> You are your own boss when it comes to going to work and picking your hours. You work whenever you want and take a break or even stop working at any moment. All you need to do is go online/offline. </p>
