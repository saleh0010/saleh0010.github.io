<p> I first start my day cleaning the inside and outside of my beautiful Honda Accord. keeping the car clean and refreshed is always a plus. Shining the wheels and the outside of the car may not seem like a big deal but it does help you get great reviews. You turn the driver mode on and start driving, when you get close to someone that is requesting a ride you will be notified and will have the choice to either accept or deny. I then drive to their pick up location and get them then drop them off at their selected location using the uber GPS system that's linked to my phone. They send me the money right to my debit card and can cash it out on the spot which I think is the best feature about uber, at least from a driver's perspective. I always tend to offer great customer experience and do the best I can so that my people get to where ever they need to be safely!  </p>
