<p>The Uber business is starting to grow all over the place. It is now one of the top ways of getting around and its also the easiest. You download the uber app and request a ride and your driver will shortly be there. </p>
<p>The app is linked to your debit card and it will automatically deduct the money from your account in a blink of an eye. Most people love uber because it solves a lot of their issues such as parking, drinking and driving and putting up with gas. In most states the ride is fairly cheap but when there is a high demand or surge uber ups their price and you now maybe have to pay double the price only because a lot of people are requesting. 
   </p>
   <p> A summary of this new and nice service will be provided in this webpage. What's a day in the uber driver day is like and more. </p>
